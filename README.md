# nvidia-container-toolkit

This repository provides the necessary tools to build nvidia-container-toolkit for Unraid.  
Together with the [libnvidia-container](https://github.com/unraid/libnvidia-container) the [Nvidia Driver Plugin](https://github.com/unraid/unraid-nvidia-driver) allows users to fully utilize their Nvidia graphics cards in containerized applications on Unraid.

**Features:**
- Automated builds: Scheduled checks ensure that the nvidia-container-toolkit is always up-to-date with the latest versions.
- Simplified setup process for leveraging Nvidia GPUs with Docker on Unraid.
